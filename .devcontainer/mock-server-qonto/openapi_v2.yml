        ## Attributes details

        ##### Initiator ID
          Identifies the member that initiated the external transfer. For external transfers initiated via the API, it will always be the owner of the OAuth2 token.

        ##### Debit
        - `debit_iban`: Can be any of the organization's bank accounts. IBAN formatted ISO 13616.
        - `debit_amount`: The amount that will be debited from your Qonto account.
        - `debit_amount_cents`: The amount that will be debited from you Qonto account in an integer format.
        - `debit_currency`: Must be EUR. ISO 4217 formatted.

        ##### Credit
        - `credit_amount`: The amount that the beneficiary will receive.
        - `credit_amount_cents`: The amount that the beneficiary will receive in an integer format.
        - `credit_currency`: Equals debit currency if issued in the SEPA network (only supported currencies). ISO 4217 format. Allowed value for international transfers: AUD, CAD, CHF, CNY, CZK, DKK, GBP, HKD, HRK, HUF, ILS, JPY, NOK, NZD, PLN, RON, SEK, USD

        ##### FX rate
        - `rate_applied`: Foreign exchange rate applied to your transaction, formatted with 4 digits after comma. Ex: 1,1082

        #### Timestamps

        Each external transfer contains three timestamps:

        * `created_at`, UTC, the time at which the external transfer was first recorded.
        * `processed_at`, UTC, when the external transfer has been started to be processed by Qonto.
        * `completed_at`, UTC, when the external transfer is in its final state, either settled or declined.
        * `scheduled_date`, YYYY-MM-DD, indicates when the external transfer was scheduled to be sent by Qonto.

        ##### Status
        `status` can contain the following values

        * `pending`: External transfer is created and has not been processed yet. If transfer is not processed within next minute, it means either execution date may not been reached yet or we are running some compliance checks on this transfer.
        * `processing`: External transfer processing means account balance is debited and a transaction has been created. Processing status can last up to multiple hours until transfer is sent in the network to the beneficiary.
        * `canceled`: When the external transfer is canceled by a user in the interface. This is a permanent status.
        * `declined`: When the external transfer processing fails for various reasons. This is a permanent status.
        * `settled`: When the external transfer is sent to the network, transfer is settled. This is a permanent status.

        ## Filters

        #### `status`
        External transfers can be filtered by status. The `status` query parameter accepts an array of statuses as value. The possible values are: `pending`, `processing`, `canceled`, `declined` and `settled`.

        For example, if you want to retrieve several External Transfers statuses, you can use the following filter: `status[]=processing&status[]=declined&status[]=settled`

        #### `beneficiary_ids`
        Allows filtering on a list of beneficiary IDs


        #### `updated_at` / `scheduled_date`
        External transfers can be filtered according to both `updated_at` and `scheduled_date` fields.
        This is particularly useful to retrieve only the latest external transfers in your application.
        Two filters are available :

        - **updated_at**
          - `updated_at_from`: Minimum value (e.g: `2019-01-10T11:47:53.123Z`)
          - `updated_at_to`: Maximum value
        - **scheduled_date**
          - `scheduled_date_from`: Minimum value
          - `scheduled_date_to`: Maximum value

        **Do note**:

        - *You can use one or the other `updated_at` filter (same for `scheduled_date`), or use them in combination if you want external transfers updated within a specific timeframe.*
        - *`updated_at` / `scheduled_date` filters should have a valid date time format (**ISO 8601** for instance)*

        ## Sorting

        External transfers can be sorted by a specific field and order. The `sort_by` query parameter accepts a string defining these two items with the `field:order` format.

        #### Field

        - `scheduled_date` and `updated_at` values are available.

        #### Order

        - Two values are available : `asc` (Ascending) / `desc` (Descending)
        - By default the order used to sort external transfers is `desc`

        **Do note**: You can use a combination of field and order to define how to sort external transfers:
        - Only field (e.g `updated_at`, order will have default value `desc`)
        - Only order (e.g `:asc`, field will have default value `updated_at`)
        - Both (e.g `updated_at:asc`)

        OAuth scope: `payment.write`

        ---
        Automated creation of an external transfer with no user interaction involved once the beneficiary is trusted.

        ---
        This endpoint allows you to execute transfers for a given beneficiary. The benefiary must be trusted for the transfer to be created. You can find out more how to trust a beneficiary in [our documentation](https://api-doc.qonto.com/docs/business-api/b3A6MjMyNzk4NTc-trust-a-list-of-beneficiaries).

        The API supports idempotency for safely retrying requests without accidentally performing the same operation twice. The idempotency key must be a unique string. We recommend using a UUID.

        ## Request parameter details

        #### `X-Qonto-Idempotency-Key` header

        This is a unique string (we advise to use a `uuid`) that identifies a transfer. This is used by Qonto to prevent "double spending" by accidentaly replaying the same API call.

        ##### Amount and Currency
        * The `amount` corresponds to the amount of the transaction in the `currency` of the bank account. Amounts must be https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#dfn-valid-decimal-monetary-value
        * The `currency` should be EUR.

        ##### Reference
        * Transfer reference that can be used to enter transfer details to further describe the transfer
        * Maximum `reference` length is `99` characters

        ##### Debit iban
        * `debit_iban`: IBAN of account to debit

        ##### Attachments
        You can link up to 5 attachments per transfer by passing the `attachment_ids` parameter. You can upload your attachments using our [POST /v2/attachments](https://qonto-next.stoplight.io/docs/business-api/branches/create-attachments/b3A6MzU2NjMxMzU-upload-attachment) endpoint. **Note: For SEPA transfers above 30,000 EUR at least one attachment is required**

        **Accessible only using Strong Customer Authentication**. More details in [our documentation](https://api-doc.qonto.com/docs/business-api/ZG9jOjI5MDg3NzA4-strong-customer-authentication)

        ---

        **Solo basic plans**

        - Create a single transfer with creditor data.
        - **Solo basic** plans are not allowed to do bulk transfers. If a bulk transfer is attempted, it will fail and an error will be returned.

        **Rest of plans**

        Create a maximum of 400 external transfers with creditor data.
        This API requires user interaction both for creation and approval of the external transfers. If you are interested in machine-to-machine communication without **Strong Customer Authentication**, check our [external transfer with trusted beneficiaries](https://api-doc.qonto.com/docs/business-api/47280509cae8c-create-an-external-transfer) endpoint.

        The API supports idempotency for safely retrying requests without accidentally performing the same operation twice. The idempotency key must be a unique string. We recommend using a UUID.

        When there is a `422` error, the easiest way to identify the invalid external transfer in the list, look at the `errors[x].source.pointer`. The structure of the pointer will be the root key which will always be `external_transfers`, followed by the index of the ID in the list. For example, `/external_transfers/1/amount` indicates that the second entry in the external transfers array is unprocessable due to its amount.

        ## Max number of transfers : 400

        ## Attributes details

        ##### Initiator ID
          Identifies the member that initiated the external transfer. For checkouts initiated via the API, it will always be the owner of the OAuth2 token.

        ##### Debit
        - `debit_iban`: Can be any of the organization's bank accounts. IBAN formatted ISO 13616.
        - `debit_amount`: The amount that will be debited from your Qonto account.
        - `debit_amount_cents`: The amount that will be debited from you Qonto account in an integer format.
        - `debit_currency`: Must be EUR. ISO 4217 formatted.

        ##### Credit
        - `credit_amount`: The amount that the creditor will receive.
        - `credit_amount_cents`: The amount that the creditor will receive in an integer format.
        - `credit_currency`: Equals debit currency if issued in the SEPA network (only supported currencies). ISO 4217 format.

        ##### FX rate
        - `rate_applied`: Foreign exchange rate applied to your transaction, formatted with 4 digits after comma. Ex: 1,1082

        #### Timestamps

        Each external transfer contains three timestamps:

        * `created_at`, UTC, the time at which the external transfer was first recorded.
        * `processed_at`, UTC, when the external transfer has been started to be processed by Qonto.
        * `completed_at`, UTC, when the external transfer is in its final state, either settled or declined.
        * `scheduled_date`, YYYY-MM-DD, indicates when the external transfer was scheduled to be sent by Qonto.

        ##### Status
        `status` can contain the following values

        * `pending`: External transfer is created and has not been processed yet. If transfer is not processed within next minute, it means either execution date may not been reached yet or we are running some compliance checks on this transfer.
        * `processing`: External transfer processing means account balance is debited and a transaction has been created. Processing status can last up to multiple hours until transfer is sent in the network to the beneficiary.
        * `canceled`: When the external transfer is canceled by a user in the interface. This is a permanent status.
        * `declined`: When the external transfer processing fails for various reasons. This is a permanent status.
        * `settled`: When the external transfer is sent to the network, transfer is settled. This is a permanent status.

        ## Request parameter details

        ##### Idempotency_key

        This is a unique string (we advise to use a `uuid`) that identifies a transfer. This is used by Qonto to prevent "double spending" by accidentaly replaying the same API call.

        The `idempotency_key` must be the same for all the call sequence used during the SCA flow :

        - For each transfer, The `idempotency_key` is first set on the initial call, which will trigger the SCA flow.
        - The **same** `idempotency_key` **must** be used on the final call that includes the SCA token.

        This is so because the two calls are actually related to the **same transfer**.

        ##### Amount and Currency
        * The `amount` corresponds to the amount of the transaction in the `currency` of the bank account. Amounts must be https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#dfn-valid-decimal-monetary-value
        * The `currency` should be EUR.

        ##### Reference
        * Transfer reference that can be used to enter transfer details to further describe the transfer
        * Maximum `reference` length is `140` characters

        ##### Debit iban
        * `debit_iban`: IBAN of account to debit

        ##### Creditor
        * `credit_iban`: IBAN of account to credit
        * `credit_account_name`: The name of the credit account
        * `credit_account_currency`: Can be either the currency of the `debit_iban` or the currency of the creditor. Allowed values is only `EUR` at the moment.

        ##### Attachments
        You can link up to 5 attachments per transfer by passing the `attachment_ids` parameter. You can upload your attachments using our [POST /v2/attachments](https://qonto-next.stoplight.io/docs/business-api/branches/create-attachments/b3A6MzU2NjMxMzU-upload-attachment) endpoint. **Note: For SEPA transfers above 30,000 EUR at least one attachment is required**

        Retrieve a list of beneficiaries.

        ---

        ## Attributes details

        #### Trusted
        `trusted` indicates whether you can automate transfer through API to the beneficiary or not.

        #### Timestamps
        Each beneficiary contains two timestamps:

        * `created_at`, UTC, the time at which the beneficiary was first recorded.
        * `updated_at`, UTC, the time at which the beneficiary was last updated.

        ##### Status
        `status` can contain the following values

        * `pending`: Beneficiary is created but no Strong Customer Authentication or Transfer has ever been done on this beneficiary.
        * `validated`: Beneficiary is created and at least one Strong Customer Authentication or Transfer has been done to this beneficiary.
        * `declined`: Beneficiary is malformatted and prevent from Qonto to processing transfer.

        ##### Bank account
        Fields in the `bank_account` object will be populated depending upon the type of the account. If the type is:
          - Swift BIC or SEPA: `iban`, `currency` and `bic` will be present.
          - Swift code: `account_number`, `swift_sort_code`, `intermediary_bank_bic` and `currency` will be present.
          - Swift routing number: `account_number`, `routing_number`, `intermediary_bank_bic` and `currency` will be present.

        ## Filters

        #### `status`
        Beneficiaries can be filtered by status. The `status` query parameter accepts an array of statuses as value. The possible values are: `pending`, `validated` and `declined`.

        For example, if you want to retrieve several Beneficiaries statuses, you can use the following filter: `status[]=pending&status[]=validated&status[]=declined`

        #### `trusted`
        Boolean property that can filter beneficiaries by `true` or `false`.

        #### `iban`
        Beneficiaries can be filtered by IBAN. The `iban` query parameter accepts an array of IBANs as value.

        #### `updated_at`
        Beneficiaries can be filtered by the `updated_at` field.
        This is particularly useful to retrieve only the latest beneficiaries in your application.

        - **updated_at**
          - `updated_at_from`: Minimum value (e.g: `2019-01-10T11:47:53.123Z`)
          - `updated_at_to`: Maximum value

        **Do note**:
        - *`updated_at` filters should have a valid date time format (**ISO 8601** for instance)*

        ## Sorting

        Beneficiaries can be sorted by a specific field and order. The `sort_by` query parameter accepts a string defining these two items with the `field:order` format.

        #### Field

        - `updated_at` value is available.

        #### Order

        - Two values are available : `asc` (Ascending) / `desc` (Descending)
        - By default the order used to sort beneficiaries is `desc`

        **Do note**: You can use a combination of field and order to define how to sort beneficiaries:
        - Only field (e.g `updated_at`, order will have default value `desc`)
        - Only order (e.g `:asc`, field will have default value `updated_at`)
        - Both (e.g `updated_at:asc`)

        **Note**: This endpoint can only be used via the OAuth2 authentication. If you are using a login along with a secret key as described on [this page](https://api-doc.qonto.com/docs/business-api/ZG9jOjQ2NDA2-introduction) you will need to switch to the OAuth2 authentication. You can find instructions on how to begin using OAuth2 in [our documentation](https://api-doc.qonto.com/docs/business-api/ZG9jOjg0MjE3NzE-o-auth-introduction).

        When there is a `422` error, the easiest way to identify which ID in the list is the invalid one, look at the `errors[x].source.pointer`. The structure of the pointer will be the root key which will always be `beneficiaries`, followed by the index of the ID in the list. For example, if in the array of IDs `["abc", "xyz"]` the first ID cannot be found the pointer will be `/beneficiaries/0/id`.

        Untrust an array of beneficiaries. Max number of IDs is 400.

        ---

        When there is a `422` error, the easiest way to identify which ID in the list is the invalid one, look at the `errors[x].source.pointer`. The structure of the pointer will be the root key which will always be `beneficiaries`, followed by the index of the ID in the list. For example, if in the array of IDs `["abc", "xyz"]` the first ID cannot be found the pointer will be `/beneficiaries/0/id`.

          You have to specify multipart form data in order to attach the file to the request. When using `curl` it will look like that:

          ```
          curl --request POST \
            --url https://thirdparty.qonto.com/v2/attachments \
            -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
            -H "Authorization: {Auth}" \

        This endpoint allows you to upload an attachment to be then linked to an external transfer. Valid files are: JPEG, PNG and PDFs. The endpoint is particularly useful when you want to link an attachment to an external transfer via [POST /v2/external_transfers](https://api-doc.qonto.com/docs/business-api/b3A6MjM2NDE0OTk-create-an-external-transfer) and [POST /v2/external_transfers/checkout](https://api-doc.qonto.com/docs/business-api/b3A6MzAxODAwMDI-create-external-transfers-with-creditor-data).

        Inside Qonto, attachments are files uploaded onto transactions by users. Attachments typically correspond to the *invoice* or *receipt*, and are used to justify the transactions from a bookkeeping standpoint.

        Obtain the details (e.g: download URL) for a specific attachment.

        ---

        Inside Qonto, attachments are files uploaded onto transactions by users. Attachments typically correspond to the *invoice* or *receipt*, and are used to justify the transactions from a bookkeeping standpoint.

        You can retrieve the IDs of those attachments inside each Transaction object, by calling [List transactions](/reference/openapi_v2.yml/paths/~1v2~1transactions/get).

        Probative attachment is another version of attachment, compliant with [PAdES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAdES) standard.

        **Important**: for security reasons, the `url` you retrieve for each Attachment is only valid for 30 minutes. If you need to download the file after more than 30 minutes, you will need to perform another authenticated call in order to generate a new download URL.

        Retrieve the list and details of a company's bank accounts.

        ---

        The response contains the list of bank accounts of the authenticated company.

        The `balance` represents the actual amount of money on the account, in Euros. The `authorized_balance` represents the amount available for payments, taking into account transactions that are being processed. [More information here](https://support.qonto.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000493249-How-is-the-balance-of-my-account-calculated-)

        The bank account's `slug` and `iban` will be required for you to retrieve the list of transactions inside that bank account, using  [List transactions](/reference/openapi_v2.yml/paths/~1v2~1transactions/get).

        Upload an attachment to a transaction

        ---

        This endpoint allows you to upload an attachment to a transaction.

        Inside Qonto, attachments are files uploaded onto transactions by users. Attachments typically correspond to the *invoice* or *receipt*, and are used to justify the transactions from a bookkeeping standpoint.

        Probative attachment is another version of attachment, compliant with [PAdES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAdES) standard.

        **Important**: for security reasons, the `url` you retrieve for each Attachment is only valid for 30 minutes. If you need to download the file after more than 30 minutes, you will need to perform another authenticated call in order to generate a new download URL.


        <!-- theme: info -->
        > The uploaded file will be processed in the background. This means that the created attachment will not be visible immediately.

        Retrieve the list of attachments within a transaction.

        ---

        Inside Qonto, attachments are files uploaded onto transactions by users. Attachments typically correspond to the *invoice* or *receipt*, and are used to justify the transactions from a bookkeeping standpoint.

        Probative attachment is another version of attachment, compliant with [PAdES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAdES) standard.

        **Important**: for security reasons, the `url` you retrieve for each Attachment is only valid for 30 minutes. If you need to download the file after more than 30 minutes, you will need to perform another authenticated call in order to generate a new download URL.

        ---

        Retrieve all transactions within a particular bank account. Query param `iban=` is required. See further details below.

        ---

        The response contains the list of transactions that contributed to the bank account's balances (e.g., incomes, transfers, cards). All transactions visible in Qonto's UI can be fetched, as of API V2.

        ## Attributes details

        ##### Amount

        * The `amount`, `amount_cents` and `currency` correspond to the amount of the transaction in the currency of the bank account (in our case, it will be in **euros** as it is our only supported bank account currency).
        * The `local_amount`, `local_amount_cents` and `local_currency` correspond to the amount of the transaction in the **foreign currency** (if any)
          * e.g, for a transaction of 10.00 USD, `local_amount_cents` takes a `1000`value, and `local_currency`takes on a `USD` value

        ##### Settled Balance

        The `settled_balance` and `settled_balance_cents` represent the actual amount of money on the account as the transaction settled, in Euros.

        ##### VAT

        * The `vat_amount` and `vat_amount_cents` contains the amount aggregate for all the VAT.
        * The `vat_rate` refers to the rate selected or detected. The value can be `-1` for uncategorized rate (e.g in France any value which is not in `0, 2.1, 5.5, 10, 20`) or for transactions with multiple VAT.
          * e.g, for a transaction of 10.00 EUR with 10% VAT, `vat_amount_cents` takes a `91` value, and `vat_rate` takes a `10` value.

        If you want to check specific information for each VAT, you can use `includes[]=vat_details`. Please refer to the [Embedded resources section](#embedded-resources) for more details about this.

        **Do note:** If you"re a user of VAT auto-detection feature, only confirmed VAT information will appear in the response.


        ##### Side

        - `credit`: incoming transaction
        - `debit`: outgoing transaction

        #### Timestamps

        Each transaction contains three timestamps:

        * `emitted_at`, UTC, the time at which the transaction was first authorized and recorded on the bank account.
        * `settled_at`, UTC, the time at which the transaction was finally committed to the account, and got set to a `completed` status.
        * `updated_at`, UTC, the time at which the transaction object was last updated (any state change will trigger a bump of this timestamp).

        **Do note**: *The `settled_at` value can be `null`, for transaction which aren"t `completed` (`pending`, `reversed` and  `declined`)*

        ##### Operation type

        - `income`: an incoming transfer
        - `transfer`: an outgoing transfer
        - `card`: a card payment
        - `direct_debit`: a SEPA Direct Debit (collecting payments from other businesses)
        - `qonto_fee`: a Qonto fee (subscription, atm withdrawal, fx card...)
        - `cheque`: a Check cashed on the account
        - `recall`: recall of an incoming transfer (by the emitter beneficiary or bank)
        - `swift_income`: a SWIFT incoming transfer
        - `pay_later`: Transactions related to financing
        - `financing_installment`: Transaction related to an installment of a financed transfer

        #### Attachments

        - `attachment_ids` contains an array of UUIDs, corresponding to the attachments (up to 5) uploaded on the transaction. You can obtain details for each attachment using [Get attachment](/reference/openapi_v2.yml/paths/~1v2~1attachments~1%7Bid%7D/get).

        - `attachment_lost` contains a boolean describing whether the attachment of the transaction was marked as lost or not.

        - `attachment_required` contains a boolean describing whether the attachment of the transaction was marked as required or not.

        #### Extra counterparty data
        - **NOTE**: the field `subject_type`` identifies the type of transaction and maps to the nested additional fields with specific transaction data. Not to confuse with the attribute `operation_type` (explained above) which is a more specific categorisation of a transaction.

        ##### Subject types
        - `Card`: a card payment
        - `Transfer`: an outgoing transfer
        - `Income`: an incoming transfer
        - `DirectDebit`: a SEPA Direct Debit (collecting payments from other businesses)
        - `WalletToWallet`: a transfer between two Qonto accounts
        - `Check`: a Check cashed on the account
        - `SwiftIncome`: a SWIFT incoming transfer
        - `PagopaPayment`: for electronic payments to central and local public administration entities
        - `F24Payment`: regulatory report in Italy that is used to pay taxes and social security to state entities
        - `BillingTransfer`: a transfer related to the billing of a Qonto account
        - `FinancingIncome`: financing for a transfer
        - `FinancingInstallment`: a repayment of the financing

        For the subject types `DirectDebit`, `Income`, `SwiftIncome` and `Transfer` you will find a nested object (e.g. `direct_debit`), with these additional fields:
        - `counterparty_account_number`: account number of the transaction’s counterparty
        - `counterparty_account_number_format`: account number format of the transaction’s counterparty
        - `counterparty_bank_identifier`: bank identifier of the transaction’s counterparty
        - `counterparty_bank_identifier_format`: bank identifier format of the transaction’s counterparty

        For subject type `Check` the nested object `check` contains the following fields:
        - `check_number`: check number
        - `check_key`: check key

        For subject type `PagopaPayment` the nested object `pagopa_payment` contains the following fields:
        - `notice_number` (codice_avviso): It is the code in the PagoPA Payment Advice that identifies the payment notice, to be used for payments with PagoPA.
        - `creditor_fiscal_code` (codice_ente): It is the code in the PagoPA Payment Notice that identifies the creditor institution, to be used for PagoPA payments.
        - `iuv`: The Unique Payment Identifier (UPI) is the code that uniquely identifies exclusively a requested payment.

        For subject type `FinancingInstallment` the nested object `financing_installment` contains the following fields:
        - `current_installment_number`: The installment of the current transaction.
        - `total_installments_number`: The total number of installments.

        #### Label

        `Label` is a string holding the name of the counterparty of the transaction.

        #### Label_ids

        The `id` of the custom label that user can add on a transaction for categorization purposes. These labels are accessible using the [Show Label endpoint](https://api-doc.qonto.com/docs/business-api/b3A6ODQxOTQyMg-show-label)

        ## Filters

        #### `status`

        Transactions can be filtered by status. The `status` query parameter accepts an array of statuses as value. Here is what statuses correspond to:

        - `pending`: a transaction that is processing and has impacted the bank account's `auth_balance` but not its `balance`
        - `declined`: a transaction that has been declined
        - `completed`: a transaction that is completed, and has impacted the bank account's `balance`

        For example, if you want to retrieve all transaction statuses, you can use the following filter: `status[]=completed&status[]=declined&status[]=pending`

         **Do note**: *If no `status` is specified, the API will only return `completed` transactions by default, as they are the only ones that usually make sense in an accounting integration.*

        #### `updated_at` / `settled_at ` / `emitted_at`

        Transactions can be filtered using `emitted_at`, `updated_at` and `settled_at` fields.
        This is particularly useful to retrieve only the latest transactions in your application.
        Two filters are available :

        - **updated_at**
          - `updated_at_from`: Minimum value (e.g: `2019-01-10T11:47:53.123Z`)
          - `updated_at_to`: Maximum value
        - **emitted_at**
          - `emitted_at_from`: Minimum value
          - `emitted_at_to`: Maximum value
        - **settled_at**
          - `settled_at_from`: Minimum value
          - `settled_at_to`: Maximum value

        **Do note**:

        - *You can use one or the other `updated_at` filter (same for `settled_at`), or use them in combination if you want transactions updated within a specific timeframe.*
        - *`updated_at` / `settled_at` / `emmitted_at` filters should have a valid date time format (**ISO 8601** for instance)*

        #### Side

        Transactions can be filtered using the `side` (credit or debit) query params : `side=credit` or `side=debit`.

        #### Operation Type

        Transactions can be filtered based on their `operation_type`. An array of values can be passed as query params :

        `operation_type[]=card&operation_type[]=transfer&operation_type[]=income`

        #### with or wihtout attachment(s)

        Transactions can be filtered based on the presence of one or more attachments. This is achieved using the `with_attachments` boolean param :

        `with_attachments=false`

        ## Sorting

        Transactions can be sorted by a specific field and order. The `sort_by` query parameter accepts a string defining these two items with the `field:order` format.

        #### Field

        - `updated_at`, `settled_at` and `emitted_at` values are available.
        - By default the field used to sort transactions is `settled_at`

        #### Order

        - Two values are available : `asc` (Ascending) / `desc` (Descending)
        - By default the order used to sort transactions is `desc`

        **Do note**: You can use a combination of field and order to define how to sort transactions :
        - Only field (e.g `updated_at`, order will have default value `desc`)
        - Only order (e.g `:asc`, field will have default value `settled_at`)
        - Both (e.g `updated_at:asc`)

        ## Embedded resources

        When searching transactions, it is possible to require associated resources to be embedded in the JSON response.

        #### Labels

        For each transaction, `labels` can be embedded in the response object, using the `includes` params :

        `includes[]=labels`

        #### Attachments

        For each transaction, `attachments` can be embedded in the response object, using the `includes` params :

        `includes[]=attachments`

        #### VAT details

        For each transaction, `vat_details` can be embedded in the response object, using the `includes` params :

        `includes[]=vat_details`

        The field will have an `items` property containing information per specific VAT line in the transaction as follows:
          * `amount`, `amount_cents`: amounts per specific VAT.
          * `amount_excluding_vat`, `amount_excluding_vat_cents`: amount excluding VAT.
          * `rate`: rate selected or detected. The value can be `-1` for uncategorized rate (e.g in France any value which is not in `0, 2.1, 5.5, 10, 20`).

        ## Pagination
        Default number of items per page is 100, max items per page is 100. Pagination data is returned in the response : [See Schema here](https://api-doc.qonto.com/docs/business-api/c2NoOjI3NTA2MjA3-pagination).

        Retrieve a single transaction within a particular bank account.

        ---

        The response contains a single transaction that contributed to the bank account's balances (e.g., incomes, transfers, cards). All transactions visible in Qonto's UI can be fetched, as of API V2.

        ## Attributes details

        ##### Amount

        * The `amount`, `amount_cents` and `currency` correspond to the amount of the transaction in the currency of the bank account (in our case, it will be in **euros** as it is our only supported bank account currency).
        * The `local_amount`, `local_amount_cents` and `local_currency` correspond to the amount of the transaction in the **foreign currency** (if any)
          * e.g, for a transaction of 10.00 USD, `local_amount_cents` takes a `1000`value, and `local_currency`takes on a `USD` value

        ##### Settled Balance

        The `settled_balance` and `settled_balance_cents` represent the actual amount of money on the account as the transaction settled, in Euros.

        ##### VAT

        * The `vat_amount` and `vat_amount_cents` contains the amount aggregate for all the VAT.
        * The `vat_rate` refers to the rate selected or detected. The value can be `-1` for uncategorized rate (e.g in France any value which is not in `0, 2.1, 5.5, 10, 20`) or for transactions with multiple VAT.
          * e.g, for a transaction of 10.00 EUR with 10% VAT, `vat_amount_cents` takes a `91` value, and `vat_rate` takes a `10` value.

        If you want to check specific information for each VAT, you can use `includes[]=vat_details`. Please refer to the [Embedded resources section](#embedded-resources) for more details about this.

        **Do note:** If you"re a user of VAT auto-detection feature, only confirmed VAT information will appear in the response.

        * `updated_at`, UTC, the time at which the transaction was last updated

        **Do note**: *The `settled_at` value can be `null`, for transaction which aren"t `completed` (`pending`, `reversed` and  `declined`)*

        - `attachment_lost` contains a boolean describing whether the attachment of the transaction was marked as lost or not.

        - `attachment_required` contains a boolean describing whether the attachment of the transaction was marked as required or not.

        #### Extra counterparty data

        Remove an attachment from a transaction

        ---

        This endpoint allows you to remove a specific attachment from a transaction.

        Inside Qonto, attachments are files uploaded onto transactions by users. Attachments typically correspond to the *invoice* or *receipt*, and are used to justify the transactions from a bookkeeping standpoint.

        Transfers between accounts of the same organization

        ---

        This endpoint allows you to execute transfers between accounts of the same organization.

        The API supports idempotency for safely retrying requests without accidentally performing the same operation twice. The idempotency key must be a unique string. We recommend using a UUID.

        ---

        You can obtain details for each organization account using [Show organization](/reference/openapi_v2.yml/paths/~1v2~1organizations~1%7Bid%7D/get)

Defaults to current date or next banking day.\n  Example: `2019-01-15`.\n\n## Filters\n`status`\n\nRequests can be filtered by status. The\_**`status`**\_query parameter accepts an array\nof statuses as value. Here is what statuses correspond to:\n\n- `pending`: a request still waiting for final status.\n- `approved`: a request that has been approved by approver. Final status.\n- `declined`: a request that has been declined by approver. Final status.\n- `canceled`: a request that has been canceled by requester. Final status.\n\nFor example, if you want to retrieve several requests statuses, you can use the following filter: `status[]=approved&status[]=declined&status[]=pending`\n\n**Do note**:\_*If no\_`status`\_is specified, the API will return\_all the requests.*\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n`request_type`\n\nRequests can be filtered by type. The\_`request_type`\_query parameter accepts an array of\nstatuses as value. Here is what request types correspond to:\n\n- `flash_card`: a flash card is a non-physical card with a budget and a last day of validity.\n  The card becomes inactive after the budget is totally spent or the last date of validity is past.\n- `virtual_card`: a virtual card is a non-physical card with a monthly budget.\n  Card holder can spend that amount every calendar month.

        **Price plans**: this endpoint is available for all Qonto price plans except Solo basic.

        List all supplier invoices for an organization

        ---

        ## Attributes details

        ### Initiator
        `initiator_id` is the member who uploaded the invoice.

        #### Statuses
        `status` contains four possible values:

        - **to_review**: When first uploaded, the invoice lands in this state for review.
        - **to_pay**: Deprecated: This status will no longer be assigned to **new** supplier-invoices. Any invoices already in the `to_pay` status can be marked as paid or be scheduled for transfer.
        - **pending**: The invoice is waiting for approval or declining by one of the authorized members (only accessible by organizations in a Business or Enterprise plan).
        - **scheduled**: The invoice is scheduled to be paid. This status is managed by Qonto as it tracks the updates of the transfer.
        - **paid**: The invoice is paid.

        ### Filters
        #### `status`
        Supplier invoices can be filter by available status.

        ### Sorting
        Supplier invoices can be sorted by a specific field and order. The `sort_by` query parameter accepts a string defining these two items with the field:order format.

        #### Field
        `created_at`, `file_name`, `supplier_name`, `payment_date`, `due_date`, `scheduled_date` and `total_amount` values are available.
        By default the field used to sort invoices is `created_at:desc` for the `To Review` section and `payment_date:asc` for the `To Pay` and `Processed` `payment_date:desc`

        #### Order
        Two values are available : asc (Ascending) / desc (Descending)
        By default the order used to sort supplier invoices is `desc`

        ### Pagination
        Default number of items per page is 1, max items per page is 100. Pagination data is returned in the response : [See Schema here](https://api-doc.qonto.com/docs/business-api/c2NoOjI3NTA2MjA3-pagination).

          You have to specify multipart form data in order to attach the file to the request. When using `curl` it will look like that:

          ```
          curl --location --request POST "http://thirdparty.qonto.com/supplier_invoices/bulk" \
            --form "supplier_invoices[][file]=@"/path/to/file1.png"" \
            --form "supplier_invoices[][idempotency_key]="4d5418bb-bd0d-4df4-865c-c07afab8bb48"" \
            --form "supplier_invoices[][file]=@"/path/to/file2.png"" \
            --form "supplier_invoices[][idempotency_key]="4d5418bb-bd0d-4df4-865c-c07afab8bb49""
          ```

          ##### Idempotency_key

          This is a unique string (we advise to use a `uuid`) that identifies an invoice. This is used by Qonto to prevent performing the same operation twice.

        - By default, the order used to sort is `name`, `asc`

        ## Pagination

        - The default number of items per page is 100, max items per page is 100. Pagination data is returned in the response : [See Schema here](https://api-doc.qonto.com/docs/business-api/c2NoOjI3NTA2MjA3-pagination).
